# NLP
The goal of this repo is to present different types of works with Natural Language Processing. This is a vast domain with many different applications that I'm passionate about. 
The first work is on an extractive text summarization. What leads me to do it was the need to be able to scan over many texts and articles I want to read in the most time efficient way. That way I can prioritize what I pick to read. It was also a good opportunity to practice webscraping with BeautifulSoup.
I also appreciate the fact that I had to clean and preprocess the text before being able to run some analysis based on the weighted frequency of each word to select the most significant sentences.
